            <h2><u>About myself</u></h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Timofei. I'm 23 years old. Currently I'm working as QA Engineer in a small IT-company<br> 
                    named TravoLab. I began my path there in a different role, though. First I came there, I was a translator<br> 
                    (which makes total sense, since I've graduated from <abbr title="Minsk State Linguistic University">MSLU</abbr>).</p> 
                    
                    <p>However, at some point there were not so much work for me, so the management decided to offer me a position of a<br> 
                    QA Engineer Trainee, to which I agreed. Long story short, I quickly grew tired of manual testing and started to<br> 
                    express interest in other IT-related topics, mainly Front-End Development.</p>
                    
                    <p>For some time, I studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript myself with the help of MDN tutorials, Pluralsight and CodeCamp.<br> 
                    Now, I decided that I need to systemize what I was able to comrehend myself as well as to learn new, more comlex<br> 
                    aspects of Front-End Development. That's why I opted for TeachMeSkills offline courses.</p>
